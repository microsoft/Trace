This feedback suggests that the action [-0.07 0.68 0.12 0.] would have been more promising. The current controller function `def controller(obs: str): return action_space.sample()` appears to randomly sample an action from the action space, which in this context has resulted in a non-efficient action. To align with the feedback, a more deterministic or goal-directed action selection method is required, potentially one that could move towards the suggested promising action of [-0.07 0.68 0.12 0.].

Given the trust level (Stepsize) of 1, we completely trust this feedback and should adjust the controller code to reflect the suggested pose. However, since the controller function's implementation (`controller(obs: str)`) isn't directly shown or modifiable in inputs, it's interpreted that the controller's decision-making logic should lead towards this pose. Assuming action space sampling (`action_space.sample()`) is pseudo-random and leads to unsatisfactory outcomes, switching to a deterministic or target-driven strategy would be ideal, preferably aiming directly for the suggested coordinates. As such, adjusting the controller function to consider the desired pose may influence the actions generated towards achieving the goal more effectively.\",\n",
