    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the `trace` package to optimize prompts and code for natural language processing tasks using the BigBench-Hard benchmark. SotA approaches on this benchmark only optimize prompts, while relying on hand-written code to extract answers from LLM responses. By leveraging the LLM-based optimizers provided in `trace`, we aim to enhance the performance of a workflow calling LLMs and post-processing their responses in generating accurate and relevant answers.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import the necessary packages and set up our environment. We will use a copy of the BigBench-Hard benchmark hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maveriq/bigbenchhard). To use HuggingFace datasets, ensure that you have the `datasets` package installed:\n",

From the provided feedback, we see that the exception occurs when executing `exception_eval0`. Specifically, the exception arises in the `extract_answer` function defined in `__code0`. The assignment `answer = response.split(\\\"Answer:\\\")[1].strip()` attempts to access the second element (index 1) after splitting `response` by the substring 'Answer:'. If 'Answer:' isn't found or there is no information following 'Answer:', the index [1] will be out of range, leading to the IndexError. In the string `LLMCallable.call_llm1`, the sentence 'Answer:' does not immediately follow a colon but merely appears in the string, hence it doesn't split as expected. \\nThe fix involves ensuring that 'Answer:' appears correctly formatted so when split, it follows with enough content to access index [1].

Analyzing the processes in the code reveals that `str0`, `__code1` and `__code0` are instrumental in crafting the prompt passed into the LLM and formatting its response to extract an answer. The original format of the string template `str0` used to generate the prompt seems to influence how detailed the LLM answers. The function `create_prompt` builds the prompt using `str0`, but the prompt explicitly includes an instruction to 'produce the fields' which might result in more elaborate answers from the LLM, not just a simple 'yes' or 'no'. To change this, we can tweak `str0` to request a concise response. The output is essentially derived from how the LLM responds and due to how we extract the `answer` using `__code0`, it takes everything following 'Answer:'. Given the feedback is seeking a precise 'yes' answer, adjustments to both the request template (`str0`) and the extraction method can be made to align outputs with expectations.\",\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The code block executes a sequence of operations involving assessment and response generation based on the question of the plausibility of a statement. The problem lies in the provided string in str0 and possibly the formulation of calls and return statements in __code0. The variable str0 is meant to construct a prompt template, and __code1 formats this to include the question. However, str0 fails to communicate clearly to the LLM that it needs to evaluate the truth of the statement, rather than asking for an explanation or any other output format. This unclear prompt might lead to LLMCallable.call_llm3 generating an unhelpful response like 'Please provide the statement for evaluation.' Subsequently, __code0 is expected to extract the answer, but its logic needs refinement to reliably parse the response from LLM. The variable eval6 results in 'provide' which indicates the LLM response was not correctly parsed and also shows it might not have been guided correctly by the prompt to give a yes/no answer. To address the issue, we need to reformulate the prompt in str0 and adjust the response parsing logic in __code0 to ensure a correct and clear extraction of 'yes' or 'no'.\",\n",
